In this project, I recreated the Blackjack game from my Scrimba course to reinforce muscle memory. This helped me practice fundamental JavaScript concepts such as arrays, query selectors, functions, and generating random values using the Math class.
The project also includes basic HTML and CSS code that I rewrote as part of the exercise.

To run this project, please make sure to extract the ZIP file first, then open the index.html file in any web browser.

Thank you!
