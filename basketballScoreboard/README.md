This is a simple scoreboard application based on a design I recreated from Figma.

I wrote the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code myself from scratch.

Each button adds 1, 2, or 3 points to the selected team using basic functions and variables â€” a great exercise in DOM manipulation and JavaScript logic.

After downloading the ZIP file, make sure to Extract All before opening.  
Then, run `index.html` in any web browser.

Thank you.
