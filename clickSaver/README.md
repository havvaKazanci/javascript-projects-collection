This project is a simple counter application that demonstrates how to create JavaScript variables, define functions, and interact with HTML elements. Every time you click the button, the number of clicks is displayed on the screen.

After downloading the ZIP file, extract all the contents and open the index.html file in any web browser. It will work as expected when you click the buttons.

Thank you!
